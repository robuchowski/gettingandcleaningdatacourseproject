## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is my, Ryan Obuchowski, submission for the week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data course project. In this submission, there are instructions on how to run analysis on the HUman Activity recognition dataset. 

## Dataset:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Files in repository:
        1. CodeBook.md - This describes the variables, data, and the work that i performed on the data
        2. run_analysis - this is the R script where I performed by data preparation followed by the five steps laid out in the assignment:
                A. Merges the training and test set to create one data set
                B. Extracts the measurements on mean and standard dev for each measurement 
                C. Uses descriptive activiy names to name the activities data set 
                D. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
                E. For the data in step 4, it creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
        3. finaldata.txt is the exported final data.
